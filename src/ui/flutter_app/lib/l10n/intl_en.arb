    "helpContent": "The game aims to leave the opponent with fewer than three pieces or no legal moves.\n\nThe game automatically draws if a position occurs for the third time or makes no remove in the last 100 (configurable) moves.\n\nThe game proceeds in three phases:\n\n1. Placing pieces on vacant points\n2. Moving pieces to adjacent points\n3. (optional phase) Moving pieces to any vacant point when reducing the player to three pieces\n\nPlacing\n\nThe game begins with an empty board, which consists of a grid with twenty-four points. Players take turns placing their pieces on vacant points until each player has placed all pieces on the board. If a player can put three of his pieces straight, he has a \"mill\" and may remove one of his opponent's pieces from the board.\n\nIn some rule sets, players must remove any other pieces first before removing a piece from a formed mill.\n\nUnder certain rules, you cannot place pieces again on points where pieces have been removed.\n\nOnce all pieces have been placed, players take turns moving them.\n\nMoving\n\nTo move, a player moves one of his pieces along a board line to a vacant adjacent point. If he cannot, he loses the game. A player who aligns three of his pieces on a board line has a mill and may remove one of his opponent's pieces as in the placing phase. If a player is reduced to two pieces, has no option to form new mills, and thus loses the game. A player can also lose when more than three pieces if his opponent blocks them from moving.\n\nFlying\n\nIn some variants of the rules, once a player has only three pieces left, their pieces can fly, hop, or jump to any vacant points, not only adjacent ones.\n",

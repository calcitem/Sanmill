  "helpContent": "The game aims to leave the opponent with fewer than three pieces or no legal moves.\n\nThe game automatically draws if a position occurs for the third time or makes no remove in the last 100 (configurable) moves.\n\nThe game proceeds in three phases:\n\n1. Placing pieces on vacant points\n2. Moving pieces to adjacent points\n3. (optional phase) Moving pieces to any vacant point when reducing the player to three pieces\n\nPlacing\n\nThe game begins with an empty board, which consists of a grid with twenty-four points. Players take turns placing their pieces on vacant points until each player has placed all pieces on the board. If a player can put three of his pieces straight, he has a \"mill\" and may remove one of his opponent's pieces from the board.\n\nIn some rules, players must remove any other pieces first before removing a piece from a formed mill.\n\nYou cannot place the pieces to the points of removed pieces again in the placing phase in some rules.\n\nOnce use all pieces, players take turns moving.\n\nMoving\n\nTo move, a player moves one of his pieces along a board line to a vacant adjacent point. If he cannot do so, he has lost the game. A player who aligns three of his pieces on a board line has a mill and may remove one of his opponent's pieces as in the placing phase. Any player reduces to two pieces, has no option to form new mills, and thus loses the game. A player can also lose when more than three pieces if his opponent blocks them from moving.\n\nFlying\n\nIn some variants of the rules, once a player has only three pieces left, his pieces can fly, hop, or jump to any vacant points, not only adjacent ones.\n",

This feature integrates both opening and endgame strategies to suggest optimal moves. This is the preferred choice for players who seek the highest level of precision in gameplay. Created through meticulous computational techniques, the database is designed to offer near-perfect game solutions.\n\nNote: Should the AI fail to access the database, it will turn to conventional algorithms for gameplay decisions. When the database is available, the 'Difficulty Level' becomes virtually unbeatable, and 'AI Thinking Time' experiences a drastic reduction. Many settings within 'AI's Playstyle' options will be overridden, as the database outcomes hold the highest priority.\n\nFor guidance on how to make the most of this flawless database, click here.",

This typically results in significantly weaker gameplay. Conversely, when 'Use perfect database' is enabled, the AI exclusively relies on the 'Perfect Database' for making decisions, instead of blending it with traditional AI algorithms. In this mode, the AI's moves are entirely based on the database's content, eschewing reliance on real-time calculations or search algorithms.",

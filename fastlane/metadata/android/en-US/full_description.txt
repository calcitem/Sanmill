STRATEGY TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS
* Playing on the cross points because they offer more way mobility to the pieces.
* Corners are weak as the player can only move in fewer directions.
* Giving the piece space to move.
* Do not make mills straight away. Usually, the first player to make a mill in the placement phase will easily get blocked.
* Black has an advantage because it gets to place the last piece strategically.
* Double attacks - be aware that players can attack two points at the same time.

 * @file test_types.cpp
 * @brief Unit tests for various operations and definitions in types.h
 *
 * This test suite checks correctness of enumerations, helper functions,
 * and utility macros defined in types.h. The tests specifically focus on:
 *   - Color toggles and manipulations
 *   - Piece creation and queries (color_of, type_of)
 *   - Square manipulations (make_square, is_ok, file_of, rank_of)
 *   - Move creation and analysis (make_move, from_sq, to_sq, reverse_move)
 *   - Basic enumerations for bounds, values, etc.

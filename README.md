[Sanmill](https://github.com/calcitem/Sanmill) is a free, powerful UCI-like N men's morris program with CUI, Flutter GUI, and Qt GUI. It is distributed under the **GNU General Public License version 3** (GPL v3), ensuring that it remains free software. Users can modify and redistribute the software, provided they adhere to the GPL terms.

[**Nine men's morris**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris) is a [strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy_game) [board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_games) for two players dating back to the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire). The game is also known as **nine-man morris**, **mill**, **mills**, **the mill game**, **merels**, **merrills**, **merelles**, **marelles**, **morelles**, and **ninepenny marl** in English.

## Files

This distribution of Sanmill consists of the following files:

* `Readme.md`: The file you are currently reading.
* `Copying.txt`: A text file containing the GNU General Public License version 3.
* `src`: A subdirectory containing the full source code, including a Makefile for compiling Sanmill CUI on Unix-like systems.
* `src/ui/flutter_app`: A subdirectory containing a Flutter frontend.
* `src/ui/qt`: A subdirectory containing a Qt frontend.

## Frontend Options

Sanmill offers two frontend options: **Flutter** and **Qt**. The primary focus is on the Flutter frontend, which is actively developed and maintained, supporting Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS for a consistent cross-platform experience. The Qt frontend is mainly used for debugging the AI engine and is not actively maintained. Users are encouraged to use the Flutter frontend for the latest features and updates.

## How to Build

### CUI

Sanmill CUI supports 32 or 64-bit CPUs, certain hardware instructions, big-endian machines such as Power PC, and other platforms.

It should be easy to compile Sanmill directly from the source code on Unix-like systems with the included Makefile in the `src` folder. Generally, it is recommended to run `make help` to see a list of make targets with corresponding descriptions.

```shell
cd src
make help
make build ARCH=x86-64-modern
```

When reporting an issue or a bug, please provide information about the version and compiler used to create your executable. You can obtain this information by running:

```shell
./sanmill compiler
```

### Flutter App

To build the Flutter app, run `./flutter-init.sh`, and then use Android Studio or Visual Studio Code to open `src/ui/flutter_app`.
The script automatically provisions Flutter **3.35.4** in `.tools/flutter` when the required SDK
isn't already available on your system, ensuring the repository always uses the expected version.

We use compile-time environment configs to enable specific parts of the code:

* `test` to prepare the app for Monkey and Appium testing. (References to external sites will be disabled.)
* `dev_mode` to show the developer mode without needing to enable it first.
* `catcher` to control the use of Catcher. (Enabled by default; disable if necessary.)

All environment configs can be combined and take boolean values, like:

```shell
flutter run --dart-define catcher=false dev_mode=true
```

Launch configurations for Android Studio or Visual Studio Code are available. Select the needed one in the `Run and Debug` or `Run/Debug Configurations` tab.

### Qt Application

To build the Qt application on Ubuntu or any Ubuntu-based GNU/Linux distribution, you must install Qt by running the following command as root:

```shell
sudo apt-get install qt6-base-dev qt6-multimedia-dev qtcreator
```

Use Qt Creator to open `src/ui/qt/CMakeLists.txt`, or run:

```shell
cd src/ui/qt
cmake .
cmake --build . --target mill-pro
```

You can also use Visual Studio to open `src\ui\qt\mill-pro.sln` to build the Qt application.

## Understanding the Code Base and Participating in the Project

## Terms of Use

Sanmill is distributed under the **GNU General Public License version 3** (GPL v3). This allows you to use, modify, and distribute the software, provided you include the full source code or a pointer to where the source can be found. Any changes to the source code must also be made available under the GPL.

For full details, see the GPL v3 in the `Copying.txt` file.

**Note on App Store Distribution**: As an additional permission under section 7 of the GPL v3, you are allowed to distribute the software through app stores, even if they have restrictive terms that are incompatible with the GPL. However, the source code must also be available under the GPL, either through the app store or another channel without those restrictive terms.

All unofficial builds and forks of the app must be clearly labeled as unofficial (e.g., "Sanmill UNOFFICIAL") or use a different name altogether. They must use a different application ID to avoid conflicts with official releases.

## Crash Reporting and Privacy

Sanmill collects non-sensitive crash information to help improve the software. The information collected may include:

- Device type and operating system version
- The actions leading up to the crash
- The crash error message

Users can review the crash report contents before sending. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected, and all data is anonymized to ensure user privacy. Users can choose not to send crash reports if they prefer.

This data is used solely for improving the quality and stability of Sanmill and is not shared with any third parties.

## Free Software Philosophy

Sanmill is free software, and we emphasize the importance of free software as a matter of freedom. We encourage the use of GPL v3 or later as a license for contributions and discourage the use of non-free licenses.

## Commit Workflow
- Before staging or committing changes, run `./format.sh s` from the
  repository root and wait for it to finish.
- Only run `git add` and `git commit` after the formatting script has
  completed successfully.

## Commit Message Rules
- Every commit message must include a body paragraph in addition to the
  subject line.
- Wrap all lines in the commit subject and body at 72 characters.

## Documentation
- After finishing your code changes, do not create new Markdown documents
  solely to summarize the modifications.

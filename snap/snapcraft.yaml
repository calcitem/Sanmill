description: |
  Nine men's morris is a strategy board game for two players
  dating at least to the Roman Empire. The game is also
  known as nine-man morris, mill, mills, the mill game,
  merels, merrills, merelles, marelles, morelles, and
  ninepenny marl in English.

  **Rules:**

  * A player who aligns three of his pieces on a board line
    has a mill and may remove his opponent's piece(s).
  * Any player reduces to two pieces and has no option to
    form new mills and thus loses the game.
  * A player can also lose with more than three pieces
    if his opponent blocks them not to be moved.
